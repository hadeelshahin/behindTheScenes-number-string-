"# behindTheScenes-number-string-" 

This project aims to delve into the details of JavaScript numbers, the Number global object methods, BigInt, string manipulation, and regular expressions. The focus is on understanding how JavaScript represents numbers, the limitations of using floating-point numbers, and exploring alternative solutions like BigInt. Additionally, explore string manipulation and the powerful capabilities of regular expressions.

JavaScript Numbers:

*Understand the fundamental representation of all numbers in JavaScript as 64-bit floating-point values.
Recognize that integers are stored as floating-point numbers.

*Number Global Object Methods:
Explore key methods provided by the Number global object 
Number.MAX_VALUE:

Represents the maximum positive numeric value that can be accurately represented in JavaScript.
Number.MIN_VALUE:

Represents the smallest positive numeric value that can be accurately represented in JavaScript.

*BigInt:
Introduce BigInt as a specialized type for handling integers beyond the safe range of regular JavaScript numbers.
Illustrate how BigInt addresses precision issues associated with large integers.

String Manipulation:
Investigate JavaScript strings and their methods for effective manipulation.
Experiment with methods like toUpperCase(), slice(), and concat() to understand string transformations.
Tagged Templates:

*Explore tagged templates and their role in preprocessing template literals using custom functions.
Showcase an example of tagged templates to demonstrate their utility in manipulating string content.
Regular Expressions:

*the basics of regular expressions (RegExp) and their importance in pattern matching.
Develop a small program utilizing RegExp to identify and manipulate patterns within strings.
